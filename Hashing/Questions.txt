âœ… Easy-Level Questions (10)
These are great for building foundational knowledge of hashing, arrays, and simple linked lists:

Subset Check
Check if one array is a subset of another using HashMap or Set.

Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Basic use of HashSet to get union and intersection.

A Pair with Given Sum
Use HashMap to check if target - current exists.

Two Pair Sum
Find all pairs from array with sum equal to a given value.

Largest Subarray with 0 Sum
Use prefix sum + HashMap for efficient solution.

All Subarrays with 0 Sum
Find total count of all subarrays with zero sum using prefix sum and hashmap.

Symmetric Pairs
Given n pairs, find all symmetric pairs like (a,b) and (b,a).

Missing Elements of a Range
Print missing numbers between two bounds in an array.

Distinct Elements in K-size Window
Use sliding window + HashMap to count distinct elements in all windows.

Advantages of BST over Hash Table
Theoretical comparison â€” focus on memory, ordering, and time complexity.

ðŸ”¶ Medium-Level Questions (10)
These require deeper understanding of hashing, prefix sum, XOR, and sometimes heap or tree concepts:

Find Itinerary from a Given List of Tickets
Construct a path from unordered list of source-destination pairs using a HashMap.

Largest Subarray with Equal Number of 0s and 1s
Replace 0 with -1 and use prefix sum + HashMap.

Count Subarrays with Given XOR
Prefix XOR + HashMap approach.

Longest Consecutive Subsequence
Use HashSet to track sequence continuity.

Pair Sum Divisible by K
Count remainder pairs with HashMap.

Palindrome Substring Queries
Preprocess with hashing or palindrome DP (medium if queries are many).

Smallest Range from K Lists
Use min-heap and HashMap to keep track of min/max from K sorted lists.

Internal Working of HashMap in Java
Explain how Java HashMap handles hashing, collision, resizing, etc.

Separate Chaining for Collision Handling
Implement or explain hash table with chaining using linked list.

Open Addressing for Collision Handling
Linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing methods.
