// if ((num[i] - '0') % 2 == 1 
// let's understand meaning of this -> nums[i] - '0'
// it means we are converting the character to integer
// nums[i] - '0' will give us the integer value of the character
// because num[i] -> is in form '3' and we are decreasing it by '0' so ---> it will be converted to 3
