🟢 Basic Recursion Problems (must do for concepts)
These help you understand the core idea: base case, recursive case, and the "call stack".

1️⃣ Factorial of a number
👉 Write a function to return factorial of n (n!).
(Not on LeetCode directly, but classic.)

2️⃣ Print numbers from 1 to N (or N to 1)
👉 Simple problem to practice basic recursion flow.

3️⃣ Sum of first N numbers
👉 Return sum from 1 to N recursively.

4️⃣ Reverse a string
👉 LeetCode: 344. Reverse String
👉 You can solve recursively instead of two-pointer.

5️⃣ Check if a string is palindrome (using recursion)

🟢 Easy-level Recursion Problems (LeetCode)
These involve arrays or strings, no trees/graphs.

1️⃣ LeetCode 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists (solvable using recursion)
👉 Problem link
👉 Classic recursion to merge two lists.

2️⃣ LeetCode 206. Reverse Linked List (recursive version)
👉 Problem link
👉 Great practice for backtracking recursion on linked lists.

3️⃣ LeetCode 876. Middle of the Linked List
👉 Problem link
👉 Can be solved iteratively, but try to think recursively for practice.

4️⃣ LeetCode 234. Palindrome Linked List (can be solved recursively)
👉 Problem link

5️⃣ LeetCode 509. Fibonacci Number
👉 Problem link
👉 Classical recursion (but later optimized with DP).

🟠 Medium-level Recursion Problems (LeetCode)
These are slightly more complex, often involve backtracking idea but still pure recursion, no explicit tree/graph.

1️⃣ LeetCode 46. Permutations
👉 Problem link
👉 Must-do to understand recursive generation.

2️⃣ LeetCode 77. Combinations
👉 Problem link
👉 Generates all combinations of k numbers out of 1..n.

3️⃣ LeetCode 39. Combination Sum
👉 Problem link
👉 Classical recursion/backtracking.

4️⃣ LeetCode 78. Subsets
👉 Problem link
👉 Generates power set using recursion.

5️⃣ LeetCode 131. Palindrome Partitioning
👉 Problem link
👉 Partition string into palindromic substrings using recursion.

6️⃣ LeetCode 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
👉 Problem link
👉 Recursively generate all letter combinations.

7️⃣ LeetCode 22. Generate Parentheses
👉 Problem link
👉 Important for recursion with constraints.
